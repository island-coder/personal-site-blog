## Introduction

Welcome to my Graphics Log, where I'll be sharing my reflective of the two parallel computer graphics courses (CS307 and CS308) at University of Peradeniya. In this post, I'll introduce the course objectives and what you can expect from my blog.

## Course Objectives

**CS307 : Computer Graphics (3 Credits)** - This course aims to give students a fundamental understanding of computer graphics, focusing on the mathematical and theoretical aspects.


**CS308 : Computer Graphics Programming (2 Credits)** - This course aims to develop skills in computer graphics programming.
The graphics programming would be done in Legacy OpenGL and capstone project would be required for completion.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, I'll be able to:

1. Explain how computer graphics are displayed on a screen.
2. Create 2D and 3D graphics using computer programs.
3. Implement essential graphics operations and understand graphic structures.
