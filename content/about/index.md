## Who am I?

Currently a final year Computer Science undergraduate with a keen interest in computing, software and data.
Particularly interested in creative technology-driven solutions for real world issues in Sri Lanka and beyond.

## My Experience

Previously engaged in projects relating to full stack web development, image processing and 3D graphics.
Has a track record in hackathons and coding competitions, having secured wins and placements.
Beyond tech, I love to volunteer on and off campus while enjoying the exchange of knowledge and fresh perspectives.
